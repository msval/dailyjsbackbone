Based on a tutorial series starting with http://dailyjs.com/2012/11/29/backbone-tutorial-1/

The original project uses 8080 port, but since this port number is often in
use for other projects I've set a default port to 38080

After downloading run
* npm install
* npm start

To build the project use

npm run-script grunt

if you are developing in a windows platform update the grunt's package.json file to
>'node_modules\\.bin\\grunt'
